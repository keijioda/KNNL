Datasets in Applied Linear Statistical Models (5th ed.) by Kutner, Nachtsheim, Neter & Li (2005)

## Description
Datasets have names in one of the following formats, depending on whether the data pertain to a problem, a table, a figure, or an appendix (xx and yy denote chapter and number, respectively):

* CHxxPRyy for datasets from end-of-chapter problems, exercises, and projects.  
  Example: CH04PR12 denotes the dataset for Problem 4.12 in Chapter 4.

* ChxxTAyy for datasets from text tables.  
  Example: CH12TA02 denotes the dataset for Table 12.2 in Chapter 12.

* ChxxFIyy for datasets from text figures.  
  Example: CH06FI05 denotes the dataset for Figure 6.5 in Chapter 6.

* APPENCyy for datasets from Appendix C.  
  Example: APPENC09 denotes the dataset in Appendix C9.

* APPENDyy for datasets from problems in Appendix D.  
  Example: APPEND10 denotes the dataset for Problem D10.

All data set file names are followed by the extension *.txt, indicating that the file is a text file.
